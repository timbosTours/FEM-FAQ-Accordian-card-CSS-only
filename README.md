## Overview
Thank you for reviewing my code, I took a mobile first approach and decided to challenge myself and only use HTML and CSS to complete the challenge. The only downfall of this is that the slow transition when the details/summary drops down, the animation only works once. I was unable to find a solution for this that didnt involve javascript. So if you have one that would be greatly appreciated. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
